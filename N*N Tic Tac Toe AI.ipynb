However, as the board size grows beyond 4*4, it's important to introduce alpha beta pruning as that will reduce the number of nodes that minimax searches at each ai turn. This will lead to a higher AI move calculation speed and probability of winning the game. The solution along with testcases are provided in the appendix.\n",
