    "Two main approaches to building trees, you might recall from class, are making separate Tree and Node classes, or only making a Node class. Which method do you think is a better fit for trie trees, and why? **Justify your reasoning in around 100 words.** You will use your chosen approach throughout the assignment, so don't rush this question."

    "I chose to implement separate Node and Tree classes for several reasons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Following the abstraction principle of object-oriented programming, it's better to isolate entities/objects whenever possible. This concept is known as modularity, and it's a best practice to follow it closely whenever possible—doing so, allowing for editing a block/object/entity once instead of going around the code looking for all the instances, the same functionality was implemented. For example, my node class in the first question has attributes of character, children, terminal, and words only. Later, in question 3, I realized that I needed a count attribute that signifies the number of times the node is crossed. Given my Node+Tree implementation, I simply added that attribute to the Node class and then used it whenever I wanted within the Tree class through inheritance. Meanwhile, if I had implemented only a Tree class, I would have needed to edit functionalities within the insert method to adapt to that now the children of self.root have a new attribute (count). This would have gone against the abstraction and modularity principles and sacrificed readability as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Additionally, having each node as a separate object/entity means that the program doesn't have to load and cache the WHOLE Tree class with all of its methods EVERY time a node instance is created. While python loads the class, and then only passes the attributes called/needed and discards the rest. That process still takes time, even if tiny."

Since we loop over each character (C) for each inserted word (W), then at the worst case, the computational complexity evaluates to O(C*W). And given that c is bounded by 26 then we can regard it as a constant. Then, there isn't significant advantage in implementing my `Node` class to house a word instead of a character. Thus, the worse case computational complexity for inserting evaluates to O(n), where represesnts (W) the number of words inserted into the trie.

Here, we loop over each character within the inserted word to check whether it has a matching node. At each character, we compare the nodes to the children. Since I used a hash table here so we have retrieval time of O(1). Then, at the worst case, the computational complexity evaluates to O(N). Notice that a binary tree wouldn't have allowed hashing which would have brought the time complexity up to O(n) for each lookup andn since we do that for each character then this would have evaluated to O(N*n). But since, N is upper bounded by 26 then the overall complexity boils down to O(n).\n",

The maximum height is length of the longest word and the maximum level length is 26. Then the maximum number of nodes is represented by 26*length_longest_word. The worst case here isn't really common and the advantages of trie trees outweigh the non exisiting cost as neither the time or space complexity here are worse than binary trees. On the contrary, trie trees will have an average runtime of O(k) and a best runtime of O(1)"

This function has a time complexity of O(n) as it has to check every element to decide upon the words with the max count.
